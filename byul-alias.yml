# Common Git Alias Shortcuts
# --------------------------
# You can customize these aliases however you like.
# Below are some of the most commonly used Git aliases:

# co: checkout    -> Switch branches or restore working tree files
# br: branch      -> List, create, or delete branches
# ci: commit      -> Record changes to the repository
# st: status      -> Show the working tree status
# lg: log --oneline --graph --decorate -> Show a graphical log of commits
# cm: commit -m   -> Record changes with an inline commit message
# a: add .        -> Stage all changes in the current directory

# Note: These are just examples.
# You can define your own shortcuts, like setting `co` to `commit`.
